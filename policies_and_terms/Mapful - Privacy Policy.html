            <p>
                For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the following terms are defined:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> Any information that identifies or could identify an individual, such as a name, email address, or phone number.</li>
                <li><strong>Anonymized Data:</strong> Information that does not identify an individual and cannot reasonably be used to re-identify them.</li>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> External services or platforms not operated by Mapfulness that may process data on our behalf, such as Firebase for analytics and crash reporting.</li>
                <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> The authorizations you grant the app to access specific device features (e.g., location or notifications) to enable core functionalities.</li>
                <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> Small files stored on a user's device by a website or service to collect and track information. (Note: Mapfulness does not use cookies directly.)</li>

            <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Mapfulness is developed by [Your Company Name] and offered as a freemium mobile application available on Google Play. This app provides location-based functionalities and tools to enhance your experience. We prioritize transparency, user control, and privacy.

        <section>
            <h2>3. Data We Collect</h2>
            <p>We do not collect or store your personal data on our servers. Any data handled by Mapfulness is either processed locally on your device or managed by third-party services, such as Firebase, for app performance purposes.</p>
            <h3>a) Location Data</h3>
            <p>Location data is used exclusively for app features like GPS alarms and geofencing. This data is processed locally on your device and never transmitted to us or third parties.</p>
            <h3>b) Crash and Diagnostic Data</h3>
            <p>To improve app stability, we use Firebase Crashlytics, a service provided by Google, which collects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Device information (e.g., model, operating system).</li>
                <li>App settings and configurations at the time of a crash.</li>
                <li>Timestamps and crash logs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data is anonymized and used solely to diagnose and resolve technical issues.</p>
            <h3>c) Usage Analytics</h3>
            <p>We use Firebase Analytics to gather anonymized data about app usage, such as feature interactions and session duration. This helps us enhance the app’s functionality and user experience.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>4. Permissions</h2>

                <li><strong>Location Access:</strong> Required for GPS alarms and geofencing. Location data is processed entirely on your device and never shared or collected.</li>
                <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Allows the app to send location-based alerts and reminders.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These permissions are requested when you first use a relevant feature and are strictly used to deliver the app’s functionalities. No data associated with these permissions is collected, stored, or shared by us or any third parties.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>5. How Your Data Is Handled</h2>

            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> Data collected by Firebase (Crashlytics and Analytics) is anonymized and used solely for app performance and diagnostic purposes.
