<p><strong>Explore and compare maps in a new way</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes you need just more than one map.</p>
<p>Improve your view of the earth's surface. Explore your tracks with more detail, simulate an airplane view more efficiently, compare and mark areas, play!</p>
<p>Two maps side by side or overlapping each other, of the same or different type (street/satellite/terrain), you choose.</p>
<p>Maybe you want to compare the size and shape of different areas visually, merge the details of a street and satellite view together, or check a point from different perspectives, and so on.</p>
<p>2Maps, here we go!&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Center your maps in the same or in two different locations</li>
  <li>Select and move your maps separately or simultaneously with a single touch</li>
  <li>Set zoom, tilt, bearing, map type for each map or synchronise these values between them</li>
  <li>Draw lines to mark areas on just one or both maps simultaneously</li>
  <li>Transpose the two maps with the full screen mode and use the transparency tool to quickly switch from street to satellite view</li>
  <li>Enable the "Use true size" setting and compare areas considering the size distortion with latitudes</li>
  <li>Save the maps to quickly reload their content later</li>
  <li>Rename or delete your saved maps.</li>
</ul>
